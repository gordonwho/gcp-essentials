# Data Catalog

Data Catalog is a fully managed, scalable metadata management service within the GCP Dataplex set of services.

## What it Does

Data Catalog provides three main functions:
- Searching for data entries for which you have access
- Tagging data entries with metadata
- Providing column-level security for BigQuery tables
- Leverage the results of a Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) scan to identify sensitive data directly within Data Catalog in the form of tag templates.
